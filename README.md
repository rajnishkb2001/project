The File Upload and Media Management System is a backend solution designed to address the growing need for a seamless and robust file handling mechanism. Built using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Cloudinary, the system allows users to upload files via RESTful API endpoints, validates their formats, optionally compresses images, and uploads the media to a cloud storage provider (Cloudinary). It then stores the media URL and associated metadata (name, tags, and email) into a MongoDB database and sends an automated email notification to the user upon successful upload.
This project simplifies a traditionally complex and fragmented development task by integrating multiple components:
•	File validation and security
•	Temporary file handling (using express-fileupload)
•	Cloud-based storage integration
•	Real-time email notifications (using Nodemailer)
•	RESTful API structure for frontend/backend integration
